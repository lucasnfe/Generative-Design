This repository contains examples (in p5.js) implemented during the University of California, Santa Cruz - CMPM147 - Generative Design course and base code for programming assignments.

# CMPM147 - Generative Design

This course introduces the students to fundamental methods of Generative Arts and Design.
The first half of the course focus on both constructive and search-based approaches and the second half
focus on data-driven approaches, mainly based on Neural Networks. Every class we discuss a new method,
including how to apply them to generate artifacts in domains such as visual arts, music, narrative,
video games, etc.  Methods are implemented in Javascript with P5.js (Processing).

The webpage of the Summer 19 version of this course can be found [here](https://canvas.ucsc.edu/courses/26749). In this webpage you can find link to slides, readings and assignment descriptions.

## Examples

This is a handson course, so we implement in class all the covered generative methods with simple
applications. In this repository, you can find all the examples implemented in the *Summer 19*  version of this course:
