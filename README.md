This repository contains examples (in p5.js) implemented during the UCSC CMPM147 - Generative Design course and
base code for programming assignments.

# CMPM147 - Generative Design

This course introduces the students to fundamental methods of Generative Arts and Design.
The first half of the course focus on both constructive and search-based approaches and the second half
focus on data-driven approaches, mainly using Neural Network techniques. Every week we discuss a new method,
including how to apply them to generate artifacts in domains such as visual arts, music, narrative,
video games, etc.  Methods are implemented in Javascript with P5.js (Processing).
